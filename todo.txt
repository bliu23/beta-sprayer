What I want to learn:
  Docker + Kubernetes (the deployment side of things)
  Properly designing some service with clear separation of API, domain, and client layers.
  Set up CI/CD

Some things to implement:
  Clear separation of API, domain, client layers
  With every PR, make sure Docker + Kubernetes setup still works
  Kubernetes setup! Some sort of deployment file and instructions on how to deploy a single pod
  CI/CD
  Tests??
  Define some data model..?
